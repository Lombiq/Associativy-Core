-	Generic services, although being an IDependency (= resolve as the same instance in the same request) resolve to different
	instances when used with different type parameters (given the mechanism of generics, this is logical).
-	Implemented IAssociativyContext classes get instantiated and injected into the appropriate objects automatically. This means
	that without additional work, only one associative database can be used in one module. However by requesting more specialized
	contexts to be injected in derived services more than one database can be used.
-	Logical and physical location (namespace and directory structure) of a type not always match!
