-	Generic services, although being an IDependency (= resolve as the same instance in the same request) resolve to different
	instances when used with different type parameters (given the mechanism of generics, this is logical).
-	Logical and physical location (namespace and directory structure) of a type not always match!
-	Calling BuildDisplay() on 55 nodes with CommonPart and RoutePart costs ~100ms. It might be slow to use this approach to build
	graphs with possibly hundreds of items.
