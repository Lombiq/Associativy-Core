-	Logical and physical location (namespace and directory structure) of a type not always match!
-	For an Associativy module to work, it should...
	-	Define an INodeToNodeConnectorRecord implementation
	-	Define an interface derived from IAssociativyGraphDescriptor and implement it
	-	Implement the appropriate migrations to set up node types and connector records; nodes should have CommonPart attached
	-	*Optionally* define routes to frontend engine controllers. This could be simply done by inheriting from RoutesBase and setting ModuleName
	-	*Optionally* add AssociativyNodeLabelPart to node content types, if the nodes should be searchable by label.
	The above are not necessary if a module just wants to use Associativy services with an existing graphDescriptor.
-	A content type can be listed in multiple graphDescriptors, thus a content item can be part of multiple graphs.
-	Frontend engine main controllers should be named with the [EngineName]FrontendEngineController convention.
-	Frontend engine configuration can be changed by implementing the engine's setup interface (e.g. IGraphvizSetup).
-	Associativy services are thread-safe.
